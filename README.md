### Questions we will touch upon:
1.    How did cases in China compare to the rest of the world?
2.    What about the rest of the world?
3.    How can we model this trend?
4.    Which countries outside of China have been hit hardest?

In this notebook, I will be using the following packages: 
1.    readr
2.    dplyr
3.    ggplot2
